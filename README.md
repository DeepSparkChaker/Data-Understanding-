# Data-Understanding
Understanding the data includes all activities related querying the data and figuring out which
business questions the data allow to answer
The main steps are the following,
 Acquire the data,
 Explore the data (query and visualization),
 Verify the quality,
==>Start with an initial data collection and proceed with queries in order to get familiar with
the data, to identify data quality problems, to discover first insights into the data or to
detect interesting subsets to form hypotheses for hidden information.

1. Collect data For that purpose, we list the datasets acquired (locations, methods used to
acquire, problems encountered and solutions achieved).
2. Describe data For that purpose, we proceed as follows,
 Check data volume and examine its gross properties.
 Accessibility and availability of attributes: Attribute types, ranges, correlations, the
identities.
 Understand the meaning of each attribute and attribute value in business terms.
 For each attribute, compute basic statistics (e.g., distribution, average, max, min,
standard deviation, variance, mode, skewness).
3. Explore data
 Analyze properties of interesting attributes in detail,
 Distribution, relations between pairs or small numbers of attributes, properties of
significant sub-populations, simple statistical analyses
4. Verify data quality
 Identify special values and catalogue their meaning.
 Does it cover all the cases required? Does it contain errors and how common are
they?
 Identify missing attributes and blank fields. Meaning of missing data.
 Do the meanings of attributes and contained values fit together?
 Check spelling of values (e.g., same value but sometime beginning with a lower case
letter, sometimes with an upper case letter).
 Check for plausibility of values, e.g. all fields have the same or nearly the same
values.
